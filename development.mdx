## 1. Creating an account on a preferred exchange
Users can choose Binance or Bybit crypto exchanges - creating an account takes only a few minutes! We also plan to connect other popular exchanges over time. 

## 2. Connecting an account via API
By connecting to TSFC via API, the user grants access to trading while keeping funds under full control.

## 3. Success Fee
The client pays 30% of profit only for successful investments once a quarter. The system uses the Base Deposit Amount (BDA), which changes only when the client deposits or withdraws funds.
Fee is calculated using the formula:

> Fee = (Total - BDA) * 0.3

This means that if a profit is earned on the account and then a drawdown occurs, the fee will be charged only after the loss is compensated and a new profit is generated. Thus, the commission is charged only on the net profit for the periods covering the previous losses.
