title: 'DAO'

---
1. Gives users who have placed tokens in staking the right to make decisions
regarding the further development of the community through the DAO mechanism, with their power being equal to the number of blocked coins
and the respective staking period (the longer the lock period, the higher the voting power)
2. Will be emitted as part of the staking reward until it reaches full emission
3. Will be used by user for commission payments on tsfc.io - payments using project tokens will receive a discount
4. Half of the project's quarterly profits will be used to buy and burn market-available tokens, directly converting the profits into token value (Burning tokens allows the value of distributed profits to flow into the token price)
