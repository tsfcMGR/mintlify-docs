## Creating an account on a preferred exchange
## 1. High risks of self-investment
Trading cryptocurrency on your own requires in-depth knowledge and constant attention to the market. TSFC provides an opportunity to delegate this task to professionals, eliminating risks and increasing the chances of profit.

## 2. Inaccessibility to large funds
Unlike most investment funds that require high minimum investment thresholds, TSFC provides access even to users with small deposits.

## 3. Difficulty in selecting signals and traders
TSFC eliminates the need to manually select signals or traders. Our analysts are dedicated to asset management, minimizing the risk of mistakes.

## Competitive advantages

## 1. No hidden fees
Unlike other platforms, we do not charge additional fees. Payment is made only for the achieved result.

## 2. Assets protection
Funds are always on clients' accounts and our API does not allow withdrawing them from the exchange, which guarantees maximum security.

## 3. Automation
We save users from the need to constantly monitor the market. All operations are managed by our professional team of traders.
